## Hi there, I'm Michal Janczyk!
Recently, Data Engineer, always ambitious and curious about the world, and this curiosity I try to express through various forms of creation that would have a relatively positive impact on the surrounding reality.Specializing in backend infrastructure, low-level systems and learning new technologies or tools if the need arises. A super nerd who loves machine learning, math and self-improvement.
