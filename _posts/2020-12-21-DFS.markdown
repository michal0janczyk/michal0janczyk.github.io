Today we will deal with the methods of traversing a tree, i.e. visiting all its nodes in a strictly defined order. For general trees, there are two methods of visiting **Pre-Order** and **Post-Order**, for binary trees (where a node can have a maximum of two children) there is also the **In-Order** 
method.
